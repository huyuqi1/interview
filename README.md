# interview
I have typed the project into a jar package. The name is INTERVIEW.jar
After deploying the project successfully, open
http://localhost:8080  in your browser and you will see the client page with a push message after a successful request.

You can send your grade by 
http://localhost:8080/updategrade?name=ch&&grade=22&&updatetime=2022-01-01%2012:00:02 . After a successful send the client will have a push.

You could visit http://localhost:8080/getgrade?name=ch to get grade you want.
After a successful send the client will have a push.
